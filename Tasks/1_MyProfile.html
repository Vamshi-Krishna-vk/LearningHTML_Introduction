    <h1>Vamshi Krishna Erapuri</h1>
    <h2>Student | Web Learner</h2>
    <p>I recently joined the <b>Web Development course with Vibe Coding</b> by <b>FLM-EduTech</b>, and it’s been an excellent start. I’ve learned how the internet works — from how <b>DNS</b> resolves domain names to <i>IP addresses</i> to how data is transmitted between systems using network protocols like <b>TCP/IP</b>. <br><br>I now have a clear understanding of how the client, server, API, and database interact to deliver dynamic web applications. I also learned the key differences between <i>frontend, backend, DBA, and full-stack development roles</i>. <br><br>Additionally, the <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b> sessions provided valuable insights into version control and collaborative coding practices. <i>I’m excited to continue learning and building projects consistently!</i></p><hr>
